WordPress Easy Contents will create an table of contents for your WordPress Blog posts

== Description ==

WordPress Easy Contents will create an table of contents for your WordPress Blog posts.

For example:
When I've written a long post with a lot of h2 headings I always added manually a short table of contents with anchor links to the headings at the top of the post. A long time consuming process and I'd rather do it automatically: with WordPress Easy Contents.

See this example in the post about Easy Index on my blog.
